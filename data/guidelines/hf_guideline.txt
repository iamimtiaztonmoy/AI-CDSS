Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome that results from any structural or functional impairment of ventricular filling or ejection of blood.  The cardinal manifestations of HF are dyspnea and fatigue, which may limit exercise tolerance, and fluid retention, which may lead to pulmonary and peripheral edema.  The diagnosis of HF is based on a careful history, physical examination and appropriate investigations.  Treatment is guided by the underlying etiology, disease severity and comorbidities.

Heart failure is commonly categorized into three phenotypes based on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF): HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF, LVEF ≤40%), HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF, LVEF ≥50%) and HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF, LVEF 41–49%).  Evidence‑based pharmacologic therapies have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality primarily in HFrEF, while the evidence for HFpEF and HFmrEF is still emerging.

Guideline‑directed medical therapy for patients with HFrEF includes a combination of renin‑angiotensin system inhibition (ACE inhibitors or ARNI), beta‑blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.  For patients with persistent symptoms despite optimal medical therapy, SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended.  These agents have been shown to improve survival, decrease hospitalization rates and enhance quality of life.  The choice and sequencing of these drugs should take into account blood pressure, renal function, electrolyte status and patient preference.

Device therapy plays an important role in selected patients.  Implantable cardioverter–defibrillators are indicated in those with LVEF ≤35% despite at least 3 months of guideline‑directed medical therapy to prevent sudden cardiac death.  Cardiac resynchronization therapy should be considered in symptomatic patients with reduced LVEF, sinus rhythm and a QRS duration ≥150 ms.  Referral for advanced therapies, such as mechanical circulatory support or heart transplantation, should be made for patients who remain highly symptomatic despite maximal medical and device therapy.
